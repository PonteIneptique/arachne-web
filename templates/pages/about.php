<h2>The source of the problem</h2>
<p>Understanding the sense of a word is a complicated task, especially in ancient languages in which the meaning of some words has been lost over the centuries and only a vague remaining sense is still known. Some of these words, such as lasciuus, a, um, appear to have had their meanings twisted in french translations (« enjoué, gai, pétulant, etc. ») as well as in english translations (petulant, sportive, playful in Lewis & Short on Perseus.tufts.edu). But its large use and context in Martial's Epigrammata drove us to think that its meaning has, after centuries of -perhaps- too much decency and appropriateness in translations, faded away. This is why we decided to create a way to collect more information about it and its companion in the lexical field of sexuality.</p>
